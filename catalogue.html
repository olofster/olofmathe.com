        Graduate students from ENSAD, the French art school, got to interpret 
        the permanent collection of the Centre Pompidou by juxtaposing their work 
        next to the art in the museum. The goal of the exhibit was to provide 
        new perspectives on the museum's collection. I was tasked to craft the 
        exhibit catalogue (with art works that
            wouldn't be finished until the day of the opening)<br><p></p>
       
            <u> So how do you make an exhibition catalogue with artwork that hasn't yet 
            been produced? </u><br>
            Leave blank spaces in the catalogue, give a Polaroid camera to every 
            visitor, have them take their own pictures and let them insert the pictures in their 
           own copy of the catalogue. </p>

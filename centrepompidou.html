        next to the art in the museum. The goal of the exhibit was to provide

          Opposing the somewhat staged spontaneity of asking students to interact 
          with artwork in the museum, I decided to intervene surreptitiously 
          for the opening in the museum's lavatories. After all, the theme of the exhibit was "apparition / disparition" (i.e. appearance / disappearance). Also, the restrooms were the only neutral area where a visitor might find breathing space during 
          an opening evening. </p>
        <p>I chose to interpret a couple of Italian Arte Povera works. For the

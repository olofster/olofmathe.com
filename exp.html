  <tbody><tr> 
  <td> <div align="left"> How to spark people's interest in a conference (Mediaexpo) 
          dealing with the impact of media on society? As the topic of the conference 
          in 2000 was &quot;the struggle for attention in media&quot;, we covered 
          the entrance of the venue with a 'scream'. This also became the logotype 
          of the conference. It seems to have given some visibility to the building. (Note the red carpet tongue). 
          Installation covered in Swedish press DN 3 May 2000, SvD 3 May 2000,
